akka-entity-replication supports *Event Sourcing* and *Command Query Responsibility Segregation* (CQRS). There are differences between command side implementation and query side implementation, which we will discuss in the respective chapters.

## Command Side

akka-entity-replication supports event sourcing and entity replication with the `ReplicatonActor` trait. An actor that extends this trait can use `replicate` method to replicate and handle events.

`ReplicationActor` behavior is implemented by overriding `receiveCommand` method and `receiveReplica` method.

### Example

```scala
import akka.actor.Props
import lerna.akka.entityreplication._
import lerna.akka.entityreplication.raft.protocol.SnapshotOffer

object BankAccountActor {

    def props: Props = Props(new BankAccountActor())

    sealed trait Command {
        def accountNo: String
    }
    final case class Deposit(accountNo: String, amount: Int)  extends Command
    final case class Withdraw(accountNo: String, amount: Int) extends Command
    final case class GetBalance(accountNo: String)            extends Command

    final case object ShortBalance
    final case class AccountBalance(balance: Int)

    sealed trait DomainEvent
    final case class Deposited(amount: Int)   extends DomainEvent
    final case class Withdrawed(amount: Int)  extends DomainEvent

    final case class Account(balance: Int) {
        def deposit(amount: Int)  = copy(balance = balance + amount)
        def withdraw(amount: Int) = copy(balance = balance - amount)
    }
}

import BankAccountActor._

class BankAccountActor extends ReplicationActor[Account] {

    private[this] var account: Account = Account(balance = 0)
    
    // to provide snapshot
    override def currentState: Account = account

    override def receiveCommand: Receive = {
        case Deposit(_, amount) =>
            replicate(Deposited(amount)) { event =>
                updateState(event)
                sender() ! event
            }
        case Withdraw(_, amount) if amount > account.balance =>
            ensureConsistency {
                sender() ! ShortBalance
            }
        case Withdraw(_, amount) =>         
            replicate(Withdrawed(amount)) { event =>
                updateState(event)
                sender() ! event
            }
        case GetBalance(_) =>
            ensureConsistency {
                sender() ! AccountBalance(account.balance)
            }
    }

    override def receiveReplica: Receive = {
        case event: DomainEvent =>
            updateState(event)
        case SnapshotOffer(snapshot: Account) =>
            account = snapshot
    }
    
    def updateState(event: DomainEvent): Unit = event match {
        case Deposited(amount) =>
            account = account.deposit(amount)
        case Withdrawed(amount) =>
            account = account.withdraw(amount)
    }
}

```

This example has two data types `Command` and `DomainEvent` (as sealed trait) to represent commands and events of the entity. State of the entity is `Account`. The state contains balance of the account. 

The replication actor handles commands using `receiveCommand` method. A command  is handled by creating an event. Events which are passed to `replica` method are sent to all other replicas of the entity and updates replicas state. The second argument to the `replica` method is a callback that will be called after the entity's replica state update is complete. You can receive the same events as the first argument in the callback. In a callback, an entity state update is performed based on an event. In the example, the `Deposit` and `Withdraw` commands perform these operations.

Operations that inform the client of the state without updating the entity's state are checked for consistency by calling `ensureConsistency` instead of `replicate`. The example calls this method when querying the account balance with the `GetBalance` command.

Note that when you call `replicate`, the response can be returned to the client with consistency without calling `ensureConsistency`. Simply returning the response to the `sender` in the callback of `replicate` will guarantee consistency.

The `receiveReplica` method of the replication actor implements the process of receiving an event. The event is received when a replica of another entity sends an event in the `replica` method, or when an event created immediately after the creation of the replication actor is replayed to restore the entity's state.


The `currentState` method of the replication actor doesn't directly affect the behavior of the entity; the replication actor implementer has to provide the state of the entity via this method. This state is used to automatically create a snapshot of the entity. Snapshots can reduce memory usage and reduce the time to restore an entity.

To invoke the replication actor in your application, use the `ClusterReplication` extension. When the `ReplicationRegion` is invoked using the extension, replication actors can be used. Here is an example.

The `ClusterReplication` extension is used to start the replication actor in your application. The replication actor is enabled by start the `ReplicationRegion` with the extension. Here's an example.

```scala
import lerna.akka.entityreplication._
import BankAccountActor._

val extractEntityId: ReplicationRegion.ExtractEntityId = {
    case command: Command => (command.accountNo, payload)
}

val nrOfShard = 256

val extractShardId: ReplicationRegion.ExtractShardId = {
    case command: Command => (Math.abs(command.accountNo.hashCode) % nrOfShard).toString
}

val bankAccountReplicationRegion: ActorRef = ClusterReplication(system).start(
    typeName = "BankAccount",
    entityProps = BankAccountActor.props,
    settings = ClusterReplicationSettings(system),
    extractEntityId = extractEntityId,
    extractShardId = extractShardId,
)
```
To start `RepliationRegion`, specify the `typeName` to identify the type of the Region, and specify the entity to be started under the Region (replication actor) in `entityProps`.  Then, create a `ClusterReplicationSettings` and set it to `settings`.
In addition, specify extractEntityId and `extractShardId` respectively so that the entity identifier (entity ID) and the identifier to separate the entity into groups (shard ID) can be retrieved from the message.
For the `ReplicationRegion` to work properly, the `extractEntityId` and `extractShardId` must be implemented consistently on all nodes.


When sending commands to an entity, they are sent via the `ReplicationRegion`.

```scala
bankAccountReplicationRegion ! BankAccountActor.Deposit(accountNo = "0001", 1000)
```

To reduce errors, it is recommended to perform retry processing so that processing continues even if a single Node fails.
You can use `AtLeastOnceComplete.askTo` to retry until Future is complete, as shown below.

```scala
import akka.actor.ActorSystem
import akka.util.Timeout
import lerna.akka.entityreplication.util.AtLeastOnceComplete

import scala.concurrent.duration._

implicit val timeout: Timeout    = Timeout(3.seconds) // should be greater than or equal to retryInterval
implicit val system: ActorSystem = ???                // pass one that is already created

AtLeastOnceComplete.askTo(
  destination = bankAccountReplicationRegion,
  message = BankAccountActor.Deposit(accountNo = "0001", 1000),
  retryInterval = 500.milliseconds,
)
```

### Fixing leader actor every shard

By default, all raft actors can become a Leader.
You can fix a Leader actor every shard by setting a sticky leader.

```scala
import akka.actor.typed.ActorSystem
import lerna.akka.entityreplication.typed._

val system: ActorSystem[_] = ???
val clusterReplication = ClusterReplication(system)

// Settings for sticky leader. Only a raft actor which have role "replica-group-1" can become Leader in shard given id "1"
val settings =
  ClusterReplicationSettings(system)
    .withStickyLeaders(Map("1" -> "replica-group-1"))

val entity = 
  ReplicatedEntity(BankAccountBehavior.TypeKey)(entityContext => BankAccountBehavior(entityContext))
    .withSettings(settings)
    
clusterReplication.init(entity)
```

### Configuration

On the command side, the related settings are defined at `lerna.akka.entityreplication`(except `lerna.akka.entityreplication.raft.eventsourced`) in [reference.conf](/src/main/resources/reference.conf).


## Read Side

akka-entity-replication supports the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) implementation, which provides a way to build a data model (read model) for queries based on events which are generated by command side.

### Example

First, building read model data requires the following preparations.

- Create `EventAdapter` for tagging events
- Add a setting to the configuration of a journal plugin to enable the `EventAdapter`

The following `BankAccountEventAdapter` example tags the `DomainEvent` of `BankAccountActor` with the tag `"bank-account-transaction"`. For more details about `EventAdapter`, see [this Akka official document](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.6/persistence.html#event-adapters).

```scala
import akka.actor.ExtendedActorSystem
import akka.event.Logging
import akka.persistence.journal.{Tagged, WriteEventAdapter}

class BankAccountEventAdapter(system: ExtendedActorSystem) extends WriteEventAdapter {

  private[this] val log = Logging(system, getClass)

  override def manifest(event: Any): String = "" // when no manifest needed, return ""

  override def toJournal(event: Any): Any = {
    event match {
      case domainEvent: BankAccountActor.DomainEvent =>
        val tags: Set[String] = Set(
          "bank-account-transaction",
        )
        Tagged(domainEvent, tags)
      case _ =>
        log.warning("unexpected event: {}", event)
        event // identity
    }
  }
}
```

The following configuration example sets `BankAccountEventAdapter` to cassandra journal plugin which used by event writer in akka-entity-replication.

```hocon
akka-entity-replication.eventsourced.persistence.cassandra.journal {
  // Tagging to allow some RaftActor(Shard) to handle individually committed events together(No need to change)
  event-adapters {
    bank-account-tagging = "com.example.BankAccountEventAdapter"
  }
  event-adapter-bindings {
    // bank-account-tagging takes events which mixins BankAccount$DomainEvent
    "com.example.BankAccount$DomainEvent" = bank-account-tagging
  }
}
```

To update a read model, implement Handler with [Akka Projection](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/1.1.0/overview.html). It can read tagged events and update the read model.
Using Akka Projection requires adding dependencies to your project first. For more details, see [Akka Projection official document](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/1.1.0/overview.html).

In the case of [SlickHandler](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/1.1.0/slick.html), it will be as follows.

```scala
class EventHandler(actions: StatisticsActions) extends SlickHandler[EventEnvelope[Event]] {
  override def process(envelope: EventEnvelope[Event]): DBIO[Done] = {
    envelope.event match {
      case Deposited(amount) =>
        actions.insertDepositRecord(amount)
      case Withdrawed(amount) =>
        actions.insertWithdrawalRecord(amount)
    }
  }
}
```

The definition for starting the defined Handler is as follows.

```scala
import akka.projection.eventsourced.scaladsl.EventSourcedProvider

object EventHandler {
  def start(
      actions: StatisticsActions,
      databaseConfig: DatabaseConfig[JdbcProfile],
  )(implicit
      system: ActorSystem[_],
  ): ActorRef[ProjectionBehavior.Command] = {
    
    val sourceProvider =
      EventSourcedProvider.eventsByTag[BankAccountActor.DomainEvent](
        system,
        // Note: You have to set a configuration key of *Query* Plugin, NOT Journal Plugin
        readJournalPluginId = "akka-entity-replication.eventsourced.persistence.cassandra.query",
        tag = "bank-account-transaction"
      )
    
    def generateProjection(): ExactlyOnceProjection[Offset, EventEnvelope[Event]] =
      SlickProjection.exactlyOnce(
        projectionId = ProjectionId(name = "BankAccount", key = "aggregate"),
        sourceProvider = sourceProvider,
        databaseConfig = databaseConfig,
        handler = () => new EventHandler(actions),
      )

    val projection = generateProjection()
    ClusterSingleton(system).init(SingletonActor(ProjectionBehavior(projection), projection.projectionId.id))
  }
}
```

`ProjectionId` is used to identify an offset in data store. You can set an arbitrary value however you cannot change the value easily after run the projection.

### Tips
- If you want to use Handler and Projection other than Slick, please refer to [the official Akka documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-projection/1.1.0/overview.html).
- Akka projection requires typed ActorSystem.
    - Conversion from classic ActorSystem to typed ActorSystem is possible with `import akka.actor.typed.scaladsl.adapter.ClassicActorSystemOps` and `system.toTyped` (see also: [Coexistence - Akka Documentation](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.6/typed/coexisting.html#classic-to-typed)).

### Configuration

On the read side, the related settings are defined at `lerna.akka.entityreplication.raft.eventsourced` in [reference.conf](/src/main/resources/reference.conf).


## Persistence plugin configuration

By default, the persistence plugin configurations are empty (`""`) in [reference.conf](/src/main/resources/reference.conf):

```hocon
// Command side persistence plugin settings
lerna.akka.entityreplication.raft.persistence {
    journal.plugin        = ""
    snapshot-store.plugin = ""
}

// Query side persistence plugin settings
lerna.akka.entityreplication.raft.eventsourced.persistence {
    journal.plugin  = ""
    snapshot-store.plugin = ""
}
```

It requires explicit user configuration by overriding them in the application.conf.

For an example configuration to use Cassandra as a data store with [akka-persistence-cassandra](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-persistence-cassandra/current/) see [akka-entity-replication-with-cassandra.conf](/src/test/resources/akka-entity-replication-with-cassandra.conf).

Persistence plugins to set can be selected.
For more details see [Akka Persistence Plugins official document](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/persistence-plugins.html)

Make sure the configuration has as low as possible risk of data loss to ensure consistency.
(e.g. In Cassandra, set replication-factor larger than 2, and set consistency level higher than LOCAL_QUORUM)

The data durability required by the command side, and the query side is different.

The command side is more durable because the data is replicated by the Raft protocol. However, it is recommended to maintain durability using the data store because this extension does not currently have sufficient recovery capabilities in case of data loss. This recommendation may be changed in a future release.

The query side data is not replicated like the command side data, so the data store should ensure durability. Otherwise, the query side may fail to update data.

## Serializer Configuration

Commands, events, and states should be serializable.
You have to configure a serializer that serializes these instances.
akka-entity-replication uses the serialization mechanism in *Akka*.
Therefore, you can configure a serializer of commands, events, and states in `application.conf` like below.

```hocon
akka {
  actor {
    serializers {
      jackson-json = "akka.serialization.jackson.JacksonJsonSerializer"
    }
    serialization-bindings {
      "BankAccountActor.Command" = jackson-json
      "BankAccountActor.DomainEvent" = jackson-json
      "BankAccountActor.Account" = jackson-json
    }
  }
}
```

Although the above example configuration uses [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) as the serializer, you can use your favorite serializer.
For more details, See [Serialization](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/serialization.html).
