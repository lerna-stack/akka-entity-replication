## Code Style
We use [Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) to format the source code.  
We recommend you set up your editor as documented [here](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/docs/installation.html).

## Run Tests
```shell
sbt test
```

## Run Integration Tests
```shell
sbt multi-jvm:test
```

If we want to dig in failed test cases in integration tests,
we can look at integration test reports `**/target/multi-jvm-test-reports/*.xml` using [xunit-viewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xunit-viewer).

Tips: Integration tests is not stable for now.

## Take test coverage
```shell
sbt testCoverage
```

A test coverage is generated in the directory `target/scala-2.13/scoverage-report`.

## Build Scaladoc
```shell
sbt unidoc
```

Scaladoc is generated in the directory `target/scala-2.13/unidoc`.

## Preview GitHub Pages
